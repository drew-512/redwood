# Demo: Git integration

**Prerequisites**

- Go 1.18
- Node.js 10+
- Ensure that you've run `npm i` inside the `braidjs` directory (located in the repository root)
- Build the Git remote helper and install it into your `$PATH` (feel free to choose a different location, as long as it's in `$PATH`):
    ```sh
    cd cmd/git-remote-helper
    go build --tags static -o /usr/local/bin/git-remote-redwood .
    ```

**Running the demo**

First, compile `redwood.js`:

```sh
cd redwood.js
yarn && yarn build
```

Then, build the Redwood binary and place it in your `$PATH`:

```sh
cd ../cmd/redwood
go build --tags static -o /usr/local/bin/redwood .
```

Then, start the first Redwood node:

```sh
$ cd ../demos/git-integration
$ redwood --config ./node1.redwoodrc --password-file ./password.txt
```

Then, open another terminal and start the second Redwood node:

```sh
$ redwood --config ./node2.redwoodrc --password-file ./password.txt
```

Lastly, open another terminal and run the `setup.js` script:

```sh
node setup.js
```

Now, you can open two browser tabs to:
- <http://localhost:8080/demo>
- <http://localhost:9090/demo>


Now, let's clone the demo repo.  Notice in the command below that the address of the local node is specified before the `@` character, and the State-URI is specified after.  If the Redwood node you were cloning from were actually hosted at `somegitprovider.org/gitdemo` rather than our small local environment, the leading portion of the URL could be omitted.

```sh
cd /tmp
git clone redwood://localhost:8080@somegitprovider.org/gitdemo
```

You'll notice that the file tree is identical to the one shown in your browser.  Also, notice that you can navigate to these files directly in the web browser -- the contents of the Git repo are served directly by Redwood (there are ways to handle staging/dev setups, but they're not covered by the demo).

Let's try pushing some commits.

- Try editing README.md, committing, and pushing.  You'll see that the browser updates the contents of the file instantly without a page refresh.
- Try copying a new JPEG image over `redwood.jpg`.  Commit and push.  The image will instantly update in the browser.
- Try editing `script.js` so that the function defined in that file returns `i + 100`.  Commit and push.  The script's behavior will immediately update to reflect your change, and will start counting up by 100.

If you push updates to `index.html`, you'll need to refresh the demo page in the browser to see your changes (but they will still have occurred instantly).
